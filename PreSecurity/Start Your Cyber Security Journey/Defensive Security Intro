/Room: Introduction to Defensive Security
Introducing defensive security and related topics, such as Threat Intelligence, SOC, DFIR, Malware Analysis, and SIEM.

Task 1 – Defensive Security Overview
Question: Which team focuses on defensive security?  
Correct Answer: Blue Team ✅  

Key Notes: 
- Defensive security = preventing intrusions and detecting/responding when they occur.  
- Blue teams specialize in defensive measures.  
- Typical tasks:  
  - User awareness training  
  - Asset documentation and management  
  - System patching and updates  
  - Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS)  
  - Logging and monitoring for malicious activity  



Task 2 – Areas of Defensive Security

Question 1: What would you call a team of cyber security professionals that monitors a network and its systems for malicious events?  
Correct Answer: Security Operations Center (SOC) ✅  

Question 2: What does DFIR stand for?  
Correct Answer: Digital Forensics and Incident Response ✅  

Question 3: Which kind of malware requires the user to pay money to regain access to their files?  
Correct Answer: Ransomware ✅  

Key Notes: 
- SOC (Security Operations Center): Detects vulnerabilities, policy violations, unauthorized activity, and intrusions.  
- Threat Intelligence: Collects and analyzes data about adversaries to predict and mitigate attacks.  
- DFIR:  
  - Digital Forensics → analyzing evidence (file systems, memory, logs, network traffic).  
  - Incident Response → preparation, detection/analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, post-incident reporting.  
- Malware Analysis: 
  - Static analysis → inspect code without running.  
  - Dynamic analysis → run malware in controlled environment to observe behavior.  



Task 3 – Practical Example of Defensive Security
Scenario:  
- Role: SOC analyst protecting a bank.  
- Tool: SIEM (Security Information and Event Management).  
- SIEM aggregates logs/events and generates alerts.  
- Analyst investigates alerts (failed logins, unknown IP connections) to determine if malicious.  

Question: What is the flag obtained in the SIEM simulation?  
Correct Answer: THM{THREAT-BLOCKED} ✅  

Outcome: 
- Learned how SOC analysts triage alerts.  
- Reinforced importance of distinguishing false positives from real threats.  
- Hands-on practice with SIEM concepts.
